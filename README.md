# Usage
## Set your google api key
Rename "../.env.example" to "../.env".<br>
Open file "../.env" and add your API Key.<br>
If you don't have google api keys, get them from [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform).
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY_JS  = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
GOOGLE_API_KEY_PHP = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
If you'd like to use this app just for yourself, using same api key for GOOGLE_API_KEY_JS and GOOGLE_API_KEY_PHP works for you. If you'd like to let other people use this app on your server, getting a GOOGLE_API_KEY_JS which has a restriction with http referer and a GOOGLE_API_KEY_PHP with no restriction is recommended.

## Create DB and seed initial values
Rename "../database/database.sqlite.example" to "../database/database.sqlite".<br>
Execute the following command from the command line. 
```sh
>> php artisan migrate --seed
```

## Change setting on APP_ENV
If you use this app on your server and you also want it to use https in every access, all you need to do is to rewrite "../.env".<br>
Find the following line in ".env".
```
APP_ENV=local
```
Substitute "local" to "production".
```
APP_ENV=production
```
